    <h4>Introducction</h4>
    <p>
        Z-MVC is a Modell View Controlles library focused on responsability separation and components reusability. Z-MVC is designed to
        facilitate and drive de GUI design of complex web systems, including hybrid mobile applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        View part of GUI is implemented using standard HTML 5 tags enhanced with some styling library (Bootstrap in this demo). 
        Controller logic is implemented in ES7 classes wich represent custom controllers (composed by some other componentes) or basic
        html components (HTML 5 elements).
    </p>
    <p>
        Components comunicate with each other throuh its controllers. Each component can call methods on its component controllers
        and can trigger events to its containers. Reusability is achieved by following a black-box principle: components can know
        its child elements but thay cannot assume some behaviour in ints containers. When a component need to inform or obtain some
        data from it container, it must use an event (decoupled integration). If it needs to obtain som data or activate some 
        functionality in a child component, it can ask to it directly calling a method on its controller.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every HTML element with an "id" is injected to its container controller as an instance of ZComponent class. Some elements
        can be "known" by Z-MVC and injected as specific controller objects (ZButton, ZInput, etc.) and other, as generic div containers,
        are injected as generic "ZComponent" controllers. For instance, if the view part of a component (its html file) defines a button 
        tagged with 'id="cmdSave"' the controller can call: <code>this.cmdSave.disable()</code>. To define a handler to add some action 
        when button is pressed, controller can define a method: <code>onCmdButton1_clik() {...}</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Z-MVC is based on JQuery. Each controller (generic, basic, or custom) has access to its view element in the form o a JQuery
        element called "view". View element is the root HTML element in the "html" file thar describes the view part of the component.
    </p>
    <p>
        Components in Z-MVC are designed using two files: Component.html and Component.js, each one representing one part of the
        MVC pattern (Modell is managed normally by standard JSON POST / GET invocations, and are not part of this implementation)
    </p>
    <p>
        Event handlers are written in the "old Visual Basic Way". To define a hanlder for the event "eventName" triggered by element 
        with id "component", controller just declares a method called <code>"onComponent_eventName(arguments) {...}"</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every GUI piece of and application should be designed as a component, even if it will not be reused in same or other application.
        This will ensure separation of responsabilities, enhancing mantainance and standarizing the way the GUI is coded. 
        There are severa ways to include a component in a GUI (in a conatiner componentes):        
    </p>
    <h4>First Component (Static Reference)</h4>
    <p>
        From the index page, use a div with id and data-z-component tag pointing to the Main component of your application. This way, 
        all the dynamic and complex behaviour will be encapsulated within ZComponents. Main component could include and coordinate some basic 
        components or dynamically change (see ZAutoLoad) between some CustomComponents according to user selection or application state. Static References
        are specified as URL pointing to contained component (relative or absolute to site). Loaded controller is injected in container
        controller as an object (ZCustomComponents wich is a ZComponent) throuh its controller, using its HTML "id" as name, so it can be accessed
        from controller using <code>this.componentId</code>. <br />
        Component in index page should be initiated after page load, using standar JQuery. <br />
        In index.html add script: <code>$(document).ready(() => zInit("#main"))</code><br />
        Inside body, add a div: with <code>id="main" data-z-component="Main"</code><br />
        And start coding your application from Main.js and Main.html in root web folder.
